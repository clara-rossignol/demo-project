# GitHub BIO-210 demo project 

This project's goal is to illustrate how GitHub can be used to develop a software project (roughly) following the evolution in BIO-210, but with less code.  

# Contributions Welcome! 

This is an openly developed project and we welcome community contributions, especially from BIO-210 students!
We are happy to receive code extensions, bug fixes, documentation updates, etc.
If you are a new user, we recommend checking out the detailed Github Guides.
